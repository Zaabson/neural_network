# neural_network
simple neural network from scratch with numpy
# description
implements convolutional densely connected neural network, no option for other layers than dense.

It is my second attempt, first one was without numpy and i created quite a messy code
# prerequisities
uses numpy obviously, pandas only to load data, iris dataset for training demo included in repo
```
pip install numpy
pip install pandas
```
